## Leg Tracking System Implementation
### Core Features Added:

- Added leg score inputs to winner confirmation dialog (tournament.html)
- Implemented leg score storage on match objects (`match.finalScore`)
- Added leg calculation function to sum scores from completed matches
- Updated results table to display Legs Won/Legs Lost columns
- Included leg data in CSV export functionality

### Undo System Enhancement:

- Modified undo system to preserve all player statistics during match rollbacks
 -Match-related data (progression, leg scores) gets undone with match results
- Performance statistics (tons, 180s, short legs, high outs) persist through undo operations
- Fixed player data restoration to only restore tournament and match state

### UI Improvements:

- Enhanced winner confirmation dialog with optional leg score entry
- Pre-fills winner's minimum legs based on match format (Bo3=2, Bo5=3, Bo7=4)
- Real-time results table updates after each match completion
- Added legs won/lost columns to both display table and CSV export

### Technical Implementation:

- Leg scores stored as `{winnerLegs, loserLegs, winnerId, loserId}` on match object
- Calculation function iterates through completed matches to sum player leg totals
- Undo system preserves player stats while reverting match progression
- Auto-refresh of results table after match completion

### Data Architecture:

- Match-level storage for legs (tied to match lifecycle)
- Player-level storage for performance stats (persistent across undo operations)
- Clean separation between match results and player achievements
