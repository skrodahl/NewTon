- Fixed player data restoration to only restore tournament and match state

### UI Improvements:

- Enhanced winner confirmation dialog with optional leg score entry
- Pre-fills winner's minimum legs based on match format (Bo3=2, Bo5=3, Bo7=4)
- Real-time results table updates after each match completion
- Added legs won/lost columns to both display table and CSV export

### Technical Implementation:

- Leg scores stored as `{winnerLegs, loserLegs, winnerId, loserId}` on match object
- Calculation function iterates through completed matches to sum player leg totals
- Undo system preserves player stats while reverting match progression
- Auto-refresh of results table after match completion

### Data Architecture:

- Match-level storage for legs (tied to match lifecycle)
- Player-level storage for performance stats (persistent across undo operations)
- Clean separation between match results and player achievements

# What happened before this?

- Everything else, essentially...
- In essence, all that needed to be done for the entire app framework. Just that it wasn't particularly useful or polished, nor was it especially stable (which is the main selling-point of the whole thing)
