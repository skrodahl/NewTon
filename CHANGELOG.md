  - Each match completion creates a discrete transaction record
  - Enables targeted undo operations without affecting unrelated matches

- **Surgical Undo Functionality**
  - Undo any completed match that has no downstream dependencies
  - Visual indicators: Winner checkmarks become undo icons (â†º) on hover for undoable matches
  - Intelligent validation prevents undos that would break tournament integrity
  - Preserves original bracket assignments while clearing only affected downstream placements

### Enhanced
- **Match State Management**
  - Improved validation to prevent invalid match states (e.g., LIVE matches with TBD players)
  - Better handling of cross-bracket dependencies between frontside and backside
  - Cleaner restoration of match states during undo operations

### Technical Changes
- Implemented `saveTransaction()` for discrete match completion tracking
- Added `undoTransactions()` with recursive downstream clearing
- Enhanced `isMatchUndoable()` validation using progression rule lookups

### User Experience Improvements
- Tournament organizers can now correct errors discovered well after they occurred
- Particularly valuable for 32-player tournaments where mistakes might be found late in the process
- Maintains tournament integrity by preventing undos that would create invalid bracket states
- One-step-at-a-time undo approach provides predictable and safe error correction

### Files Modified
- `clean-match-progression.js` - Core transaction and undo logic implementation
