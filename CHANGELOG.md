## **v3.0.0-beta** - Match Controls Real-Time Updates, Referee Suggestions & Developer Console Enhancements

### Enhanced: Developer Console - Lane Usage Details & Preventive Conflict Detection
- **Complete Lane Usage detail view implementation with real-time monitoring and preventive warnings**
  - **Lane Usage detail view**: Clicking "Lane Usage" statistic now shows comprehensive lane breakdown
    - Color-coded status box: Green (no conflicts), Yellow (READY conflicts), Red (LIVE conflicts)
    - Available lanes list (non-excluded lanes with total count)
    - Excluded lanes list (or "None")
    - Active lanes list (unique lanes currently in use with accurate count)
    - Live matches section: Shows lane number, match ID, and player names for each live match
    - Ready matches section: Shows pre-assigned lanes for upcoming matches
    - Auto-refresh every 2 seconds for real-time lane monitoring during tournament
    - "Back to Overview" navigation link
  - **Enhanced lane conflict detection**: `validateLaneAssignments()` now detects both LIVE and READY match conflicts
    - **LIVE conflicts (critical)**: Multiple live matches assigned to same lane - immediate issue requiring action
    - **READY conflicts (warning)**: Multiple ready matches pre-assigned to same lane - future issue, preventive warning
    - Returns separate conflict arrays (`conflicts` and `readyConflicts`) for each type
    - Properly handles 3+ matches on same lane (not just pairs)
    - Catches extreme corner case: duplicate lane assignments from undoing matches
  - **Conflict warning displays**:
    - LIVE conflicts shown in red warning box with critical alert and "both LIVE" notation
    - READY conflicts shown in yellow warning box with preventive message
    - Helpful guidance: "These matches will conflict when started. Reassign lanes before starting matches."
    - Both conflict types displayed in Lane Usage detail view with clear visual separation
  - **Updated Quick Overview**:
    - Separate display lines for "Lane conflicts (LIVE)" and "Lane conflicts (READY)"
    - Three-level color coding: Green (healthy, no issues), Yellow (READY warnings), Red (LIVE critical)
    - Overall status box reflects most severe issue detected
  - **Left pane statistics updates**:
    - Lane Usage indicator shows üî¥ for LIVE conflicts, ‚ö†Ô∏è for READY conflicts, ‚úÖ for all clear
    - Accurate in-use count based on unique active lanes (fixed counting bug)
  - **Implementation**: lane-management.js:81-133 (enhanced validation), analytics.js:807-981 (detail view), analytics.js:233-240 (statistics), analytics.js:397-434 (quick overview), tournament.html:610 (click handler)
  - **User impact**: Tournament organizers can now catch duplicate lane assignments BEFORE matches start, preventing scheduling conflicts and improving tournament flow. Real-time monitoring shows exactly which lanes are free and which matches are using them.

### Enhanced: Developer Console - Quick Overview Menu Link & Tournament Timing Statistics
- **New "Quick Overview" menu link added to Statistics section for easy navigation**
  - **Direct navigation**: "Quick Overview" now appears as first item in Statistics section of left pane
  - **Always visible**: Provides permanent way to return to overview from any detailed view
  - **Real-time tournament duration**: Shows "Duration: HH:MM:SS" (e.g., "Duration: 43:26")
  - **Dynamic updates**: Duration refreshes every 2 seconds during active tournaments
  - **Format variations**: "Duration: Not started" (setup), "Duration: 43:26" (active), "Duration: 3:45:12" (completed)
  - **Complements existing navigation**: Works alongside "‚Üê Back to Overview" links in detail views
- **New tournament timing statistics added to Quick Overview**
  - **Tournament duration**: Total elapsed time from first match start
    - **Dynamic during active tournament**: Updates every 2 seconds, calculated from first START_MATCH to current time (e.g., "43:26")
    - **Static after completion**: Fixed historical value from first START_MATCH to last COMPLETE_MATCH (e.g., "3:45:12")
    - **Setup state**: Shows "Not started" when no matches have begun
    - **Undo-aware**: Clock resumes if Grand Final is undone, reverting tournament from completed to active state
  - **Average match time**: Mean duration of all completed matches (e.g., "14:23")
  - **Shortest match**: Fastest completed match with match ID (e.g., "8:15 (FS-1-2)")
  - **Longest match**: Slowest completed match with match ID (e.g., "32:45 (BS-FINAL)")
  - **Time format**: HH:MM:SS with hours omitted when zero (e.g., "14:23" instead of "0:14:23")
  - **Seconds precision**: Shows exact match durations for accurate tournament pacing analysis
  - **Separator line**: Timing statistics appear below health checks with visual separator for clear section distinction
  - **Edge case handling**: Shows "N/A" when no completed matches exist, "0:XX" for test matches under 1 minute
  - **Read-only tournament handling**: Timing statistics section hidden for read-only tournaments (completed tournaments loaded from Recent Tournaments)
    - **Rationale**: Read-only tournaments are historical imports where timing data cannot be trusted or verified
    - **Active completed tournaments**: Timing stats remain visible for tournaments completed during current session
    - **Clean presentation**: Entire timing section (including separator) omitted for read-only imports
- **Implementation**: tournament.html:598-602 (menu link), analytics.js:251-257 (duration subtitle), analytics.js:404-497 (timing calculations), analytics.js:542-555 (conditional timing display), Docs/ANALYTICS.md:80-94 (documentation)
- **User impact**: Tournament duration visible at a glance in left menu, updating in real-time. Easy one-click access to Quick Overview from any view. Tournament organizers can now monitor tournament duration continuously, track match pacing, and identify fastest/slowest matches for scheduling insights. Read-only tournaments keep Quick Overview focused on relevant validation data.

### Enhanced: Developer Console - Match Progression View Redesign
- **Complete Match Progression view redesign with side-by-side layout and improved readability**
  - **Two-column side-by-side layout**: Frontside and Backside brackets displayed in equal-width columns for maximum overview capability
    - CSS Grid layout: `repeat(2, minmax(0, 1fr))` ensures perfectly balanced columns
    - Columns maintain position even when one side has no matches (stays in lane)
    - Grand Final displayed below in special green-highlighted section
    - Single-column mode when filtering by specific side
  - **Improved match card layout**: Two-line design for optimal readability
    - **Line 1**: Status (left-aligned, 80px width) and Match ID (center-aligned, 18px font)
    - **Line 2**: `FROM: sources ‚Üí TO: destinations` (center-aligned with labeled sections)
    - Clear "FROM:" and "TO:" labels eliminate ambiguity in progression flow
    - Bold arrow separator (‚Üí) between sections
  - **Enhanced state visualization**: Each match reference includes state icon
    - Example: "FROM: FS-1-3 ‚úÖ, FS-1-4 ‚úÖ" shows source match states at a glance
    - Example: "TO: ‚è∏Ô∏è FS-3-1, ‚è∏Ô∏è BS-2-6" shows destination match states
    - Round 1 matches: "FROM: R1" (italicized, gray)
    - Champion: "TO: üèÜ", Eliminated: "TO: ‚ùå"
  - **Progression Code view**: New debugging view showing raw MATCH_PROGRESSION lookup table
    - Access via "Progression Code" button in filter bar
    - Monospace text display of hardcoded progression rules
    - Traditional format: "Winner ‚Üí FS-2-1 (player1)" for verifying bracket logic
    - "‚Üê Back to Match Progression" button at top for quick return to rich view
  - **Collapsible Console Output**: Console footer now collapsible and hidden by default
    - Click "Console Output" header to toggle visibility (‚ñ∂ collapsed, ‚ñº expanded)
    - Main content area expands to fill available space when console collapsed
    - Console limited to 400px max-height when expanded
    - Flexible layout automatically adjusts content area size
  - **Implementation**: analytics.js:1067-1453 (progression views), analytics.js:2559-2575 (toggle function), tournament.html:675-700 (flexible layout)
  - **User impact**: Tournament operators get complete bracket overview at a glance with clear progression flow. Developers can verify hardcoded logic with Progression Code view. More screen space available with collapsible console.

### Enhanced: Developer Console - Reset All Config Command
- **New "Reset All Config" developer command for recovering from config corruption**
  - **Command location**: Developer Console Commands section (bottom of list, red text for visual distinction)
  - **Typed confirmation required**: Must type "RESET" in confirmation box to proceed
  - **Before/after comparison**: Shows detailed comparison for all config sections before reset
    - Point values (all 11 point types)
    - Match configuration (5 round types)
    - UI settings (4 settings)
    - Branding (club name)
    - Lane configuration (max lanes, excluded lanes)
    - Server settings
  - **Tournament data preserved**: Only resets config, never touches tournament data (matches, players, brackets, history)
  - **Auto-refresh**: Page reloads after 2 seconds to apply changes
  - **Visual warnings**: Red warning box with "‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Destructive Action" alert
  - **Success feedback**: Summary of changes with automatic page refresh countdown

  - **Use cases**: Config corruption recovery, misconfiguration fixes, fresh start scenarios
  - **Implementation**: analytics.js:1656-1822 (command functions), tournament.html:645-647 (UI integration), Docs/ANALYTICS.md:248-285 (documentation)
  - **User impact**: Tournament operators can recover from config corruption or misconfiguration without losing tournament data. Provides safe recovery tool for extreme situations.

### Enhanced: Config Page - Help System Documentation Update
- **Developer Console comprehensive documentation added to Config page dynamic help**
  - **Updated help for "Enable Developer Analytics" setting**: Now includes detailed feature list
  - **Real-time statistics**: Lists all 5 statistics tracked (Transaction Health, Match States, Player Counts, Lane Usage, localStorage Usage)
  - **Lane Usage monitoring**: Specific mention of LIVE/READY conflict detection capabilities
  - **Validation checks**: Lists all 6 validation checks (lane conflicts, referee conflicts, match state integrity, transaction limits, player IDs, progression integrity)
  - **Developer commands**: Lists all commands (Re-render Bracket, Recalculate Rankings, Refresh Dropdowns, Validate Everything, Manage Transaction Log, Reset All Config)
  - **Transaction management**: Notes Smart Pruning capability for storage optimization

  - **Styling**: Matches button font (14px, font-weight 500) for visual consistency
  - **Bidirectional sync**: Changes sync in real-time between Match Controls modal and Config page
    - Toggle in Match Controls ‚Üí Config page checkbox updates immediately
    - Toggle in Config page ‚Üí Match Controls checkbox updates immediately
    - No page refresh required for sync
  - **Persistent storage**: Both checkboxes read/write from same `config.ui.autoOpenMatchControls` setting
  - **Auto-save**: Calls `saveGlobalConfig()` immediately on toggle
  - **Layout**: Buttons centered, checkbox positioned absolutely on right side
  - **Implementation**: tournament.html:907-918 (UI), bracket-rendering.js:3422-3446 (Match Controls sync), results-config.js:304-308 (Config page sync)
  - **User impact**: Users can toggle auto-open behavior directly from Match Controls without navigating to Config page. Setting is immediately available and stays in sync across both locations.

### Enhanced: Tournament Page - Navigation Buttons for Quick Page Access
- **Five navigation buttons added to Tournament page for easy access to other pages**
  - **Button layout**: Positioned in top-left corner, stacked vertically
    - **Top row**: Statistics, Match Controls (green)
    - **Middle row**: Setup, Registration, Config (stacked vertically below)
  - **Button styling**: 150px width, consistent dark background with white text
    - Left-aligned icons (‚â°, ‚ûπ, ‚¨Ö) with 20px fixed width
    - Centered button text with balanced padding (32px left, 12px right)
    - Statistics button opens Statistics modal
    - Match Controls button opens Match Controls modal (green highlight)
    - Setup/Registration/Config buttons navigate to respective pages using `showPage()`
  - **Visual consistency**: All buttons use `.nav-btn` class with unified icon/text layout
    - Icons positioned absolutely at left: 12px
    - Text centered in remaining button space
  - **Rationale**: Direct navigation from Tournament page improves workflow - operators can quickly access Setup, Registration, Config, or view Statistics without returning to main navigation
  - **Implementation**: tournament.html:203-222 (button structure), css/styles.css:504-525 (navigation button styling), dynamic-help-system.js:174-177 (help text updates)
  - **User impact**: Tournament operators can navigate between all major pages directly from the bracket view, reducing clicks and improving tournament management efficiency.

### Enhanced: Navigation Menu - Sliding Underline Indicator
- **Animated sliding underline added to main navigation menu for polished visual feedback**
  - **Sliding underline animation**: 1px black line smoothly transitions between active menu items
    - 0.3s CSS transition with easing for responsive, elegant movement
    - Pixel-perfect alignment under each menu item (Setup, Registration, Tournament, Config)
    - Uses CSS `:has()` selector for pure CSS implementation (no JavaScript required)
  - **Consistent menu styling**: Removed color and font-weight changes from active menu items
    - All menu items stay same color (`#444444` default, `#222222` on hover)
    - All menu items maintain `font-weight: 400` (no bold text causing layout shift)
    - Active state indicated solely by animated underline
  - **Removed button focus outlines**: Eliminated blue focus outline from all button types
    - Removed outline from `.btn`, `.zoom-btn`, and `.nav-btn` buttons
    - Cleaner interface without persistent blue glow after clicking
    - Buttons return to neutral state immediately after interaction
  - **Rationale**: Sliding underline provides modern, sophisticated navigation feedback without causing layout shifts or visual noise. Removing focus outlines eliminates visual artifacts while maintaining clean, professional appearance.
  - **Implementation**: css/styles.css:108-147 (sliding underline), css/styles.css:164-167 (active state), css/styles.css:271-276 (focus outline removal)
  - **User impact**: Navigation feels more polished and modern with smooth animated feedback. Menu bar no longer shifts position when changing pages. Buttons throughout the application have cleaner, more professional appearance without blue focus artifacts.

### Enhanced: Real-Time Clocks for Fullscreen Tournament Operation
- **Two clocks added for tournament operators running in fullscreen mode**
  - **Match Controls clock**: Displayed in top-right corner of Match Controls modal title bar
    - Format: 24-hour HH:MM (e.g., "23:05")
    - Updates every 10 seconds automatically
    - Visual styling: 1px gray border (#ccc), 8px vertical padding, 16px horizontal padding, 6px border radius
    - Monospace font (SF Mono, Consolas, Monaco, Menlo) for stable width
    - Normal font weight to distinguish from bold title text
    - Right-aligned using flexbox layout
  - **Status Panel clock**: Displayed in tournament watermark header (bottom-right box)
    - Format: 24-hour HH:MM
    - Updates every 10 seconds automatically
    - Right-aligned in Status Panel header next to tournament name
  - **Rationale**: When running tournaments in Chrome fullscreen, OS clock is hidden and operators frequently ask for time
  - **Update mechanism**: `setInterval()` functions ensure clocks stay current without manual refresh
  - **Implementation**: bracket-rendering.js:3059-3079 (Match Controls clock display), bracket-rendering.js:4064-4075 (Match Controls update function), tournament-management.js:1202-1225 (Status Panel clock), tournament-management.js:1269-1281 (Status Panel update function)
  - **User impact**: Tournament operators can see current time at a glance without exiting fullscreen mode. Match Controls clock is most prominent since operators spend majority of time in that modal.

### Fixed: Config Page - Removed Auto-Save for Point Values and Match Configuration
- **Point System and Match Configuration now require explicit Save button click**
  - **Removed auto-save behavior**: Deleted `setupConfigAutoSave()` function and all event listeners
  - **Consistent save workflow**: All config sections now require deliberate Save button click
  - **Added "Save Point Values" button**: Green primary button in Point Values section
  - **Added "Save Match Configuration" button**: Green primary button in Match Configuration section
  - **Removed "(autosave)" labels**: Cleaned up section headers for clarity
  - **Success alerts**: Both save functions show "‚úì saved successfully!" confirmation alerts
  - **Rationale**: Auto-save was too aggressive for deliberate configuration changes - users expect explicit save control
  - **Implementation**: main.js:274-353 (removed auto-save function), results-config.js:351-392 (new save functions), tournament.html:452-508 (UI updates)
  - **User impact**: Configuration changes now require explicit user action before being persisted. More predictable behavior - users have control over when changes are saved, preventing accidental configuration modifications.

### Fixed: Setup Page - Scrolling in Recent Tournaments and Match Results
- **Scrollable areas now work properly with overflow-y: auto**
  - **Root cause**: `.scrollable-column-content` was missing `overflow-y: auto` CSS property
  - **Fixed sections**: Both "Recent Tournaments" and "Match Results" boxes now scroll when content exceeds height
  - **Implementation**: css/styles.css:2242 (added overflow-y property)
  - **User impact**: Long tournament lists and match results are now accessible through scrolling instead of being cut off

### Enhanced: Developer Console - Transaction Log Management & Storage Monitoring
- **Complete transaction pruning system with smart algorithm and localStorage monitoring**
  - **"Manage Transaction Log" command**: Opens dedicated management view showing current status, storage usage, and pruning options
  - **Smart Pruning algorithm**: Removes redundant transactions for completed matches only
    - Removes old ASSIGN_LANE transactions (keeps final assignment)
    - Removes old ASSIGN_REFEREE transactions (keeps final assignment)
    - Removes ALL START_MATCH and STOP_MATCH transactions (redundant after completion)
    - Preserves ALL COMPLETE_MATCH transactions (never pruned)
    - Preserves ALL transactions for active/pending matches
  - **Preview mode**: Shows detailed analysis before execution (what will be removed/kept, storage impact)
  - **Post-execution feedback**: Comprehensive statistics on transactions removed, storage freed
  - **Safety**: Undo system unaffected (uses separate state snapshots, not transaction history)
  - **Performance**: Typically removes 40-60% of transactions in active tournaments
  - **localStorage Usage statistic**: New fifth statistic in Developer Console
    - Shows total usage vs 10 MB browser limit
    - Color-coded indicators (green < 50%, amber 50-80%, red > 80%)
    - Detail view with breakdown by localStorage key (sorted by size)
    - Helps identify when transaction pruning is needed
  - **Transaction History improvements**: Reverse chronological sorting (#1 = latest transaction)
  - **Transaction History filtering system**: Comprehensive search and filter capabilities
    - **Layout optimization**: Developer Console left pane reduced from 30% to fixed 240px width for better space utilization
    - **Vertical sidebar layout**: Filter panel positioned as right sidebar next to transaction list
    - **Three-filter system** with AND logic:
      - Transaction Type dropdown (All Types, COMPLETE_MATCH, ASSIGN_REFEREE, ASSIGN_LANE, START_MATCH, STOP_MATCH)
      - Match ID text input (searches matchId field and description)
      - Search String text input (searches player names and any text in description)
    - **Enhanced transaction descriptions**: All transactions now include both player names and IDs for better debugging
      - COMPLETE_MATCH: "FS-1-3: Liam (ID: 123) defeats Peter (ID: 456)"
      - ASSIGN_REFEREE: "FS-1-1: Referee assigned to Chris (ID: 1760441429772)"
    - **Filter state preservation**: Selected filters maintained in UI when applied
    - **Results counter**: Shows "X of Y total" when filtered, "Y total" when unfiltered
    - **Clean UI**: Professional layout with proper spacing and visual hierarchy
  - **Storage calculation fixes**:
    - Updated browser limit from 5 MB to 10 MB (modern browsers: Chrome 114+, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
    - Fixed UTF-16 encoding calculation (2 bytes/char instead of 8 bytes/char)
    - Accurate storage estimates across all views
  - **Developer Console UI unification**: Consistent professional styling across all views
    - **Unified command feedback**: All commands (Re-render Bracket, Recalculate Rankings, Refresh All Dropdowns, Validate Everything) use consistent styled feedback boxes
    - **Status-based color coding**: Green for success/healthy, yellow for moderate/warnings, red for errors/critical
    - **Flat design system**: All views use border-radius: 0 for sharp corners matching application design
    - **Statistic detail views**: Quick Overview, Transaction Breakdown, Match State, Player Details, and localStorage Usage all use consistent status boxes
    - **Back to Overview navigation**: All detail views include "‚Üê Back to Overview" link for easy navigation
    - **Multi-column player list**: Player Details view uses CSS Grid (4+ columns) to efficiently display player names and IDs
    - **Visual hierarchy**: Clear status headings (16px, bold, colored) with proper spacing and typography throughout
  - **Modal width optimization**: Reduced from 90% to 75% screen width for more comfortable viewing on larger displays
  - **Implementation**: analytics.js (Transaction Log Management, localStorage Usage view, Transaction History filtering, UI styling updates), tournament.html (layout optimization, modal width), bracket-rendering.js (ASSIGN_REFEREE descriptions), clean-match-progression.js (COMPLETE_MATCH descriptions)
  - **User impact**: Operators can monitor and manage storage usage, prevent hitting browser limits, maintain tournament performance, and quickly debug tournament issues with powerful filtering capabilities. The unified UI provides a professional, consistent experience across all Developer Console views.

### Fixed: Match Controls Auto-Refresh on Lane Changes
- **Match Controls now updates immediately when lane assignments change on LIVE matches**
  - Previously, changing a lane on a LIVE match required closing and reopening Match Controls to see the updated sort order
  - LIVE matches now automatically re-sort by lane number when lanes are changed
  - **Root cause**: Modal refresh check was looking for `display === 'flex'` but Match Controls uses `display: 'block'`
  - **Solution**: Updated display check to accept both 'flex' and 'block' in `updateMatchLane()` function
  - **Side benefit**: Also fixed lane/referee resources not being immediately "released" when stopping LIVE matches
  - **Implementation**: Modified modal display check in clean-match-progression.js:1412-1414
  - **User impact**: Real-time sorting and resource availability updates during tournament operations

### Enhanced: Match Controls - Two-Column Layout & Modal Optimization
- **Complete redesign with Frontside/Backside visual separation for better tournament flow visibility**
  - **Two-column layout**: Match cards split into Frontside (left) and Backside (right) columns for both LIVE and Ready to Start sections
  - **Visual separation**: 2px vertical separator line between columns for clear bracket side distinction
  - **Modal sizing**: Increased to 80% width and 90% height for maximum screen utilization
  - **Referee sidebar optimization**: Fixed 350px width (user-adjustable via CSS) instead of flex-based, providing more space for match cards
  - **Tournament completion centering**: Celebration card constrained to 800px max-width and horizontally centered
  - **Setup mode input**: "Add Player" field constrained to 400px max-width for better proportions
  - **At-a-glance visibility**: Operators can instantly see both bracket sides simultaneously without scrolling
  - **Smart grouping**: Grand Final appears in Frontside column, BS-FINAL in Backside column
  - **Independent sorting**: Each column maintains proper round progression order (FS-R1, FS-R2... and BS-R1, BS-R2...)
  - **Implementation**: bracket-rendering.js:3150-3285 (two-column rendering logic), tournament.html:774 (modal dimensions), styles.css:1772 (referee sidebar width), styles.css:1391 (celebration centering)
  - **User impact**: Tournament operators gain significantly improved spatial awareness of tournament state, can manage both bracket sides efficiently, and make faster operational decisions during active tournaments

### Fixed: Undo System - Complete Match State Restoration & Resource Clearing
- **Match undo now properly clears ALL assignments and returns match to completely clean state**
  - **Critical bug fixed**: Lane and referee assignments were persisting after undoing completed matches
  - **Root cause**: Two separate data stores (transaction history AND match objects) were not being synchronized during undo
  - **Two-part fix implemented**:
    1. **Transaction history cleanup**: Remove ALL transaction types for undone match (COMPLETE_MATCH, ASSIGN_LANE, ASSIGN_REFEREE, START_MATCH, STOP_MATCH)
    2. **Match object clearing**: Reset `match.lane = null` and `match.referee = null` during rollback
  - **Resource conflict prevention**: Without proper clearing, lanes and referees appeared "in use" but weren't shown in transaction history
  - **Clean slate principle**: Undoing a match now returns it to pristine READY state as if nothing was ever done to it
  - **Why critical**: Prevents resource conflicts, eliminates blocking of available lanes/referees, maintains data consistency between history and state
  - **Implementation**: bracket-rendering.js:2185-2194 (transaction removal), bracket-rendering.js:2273-2274 (match object clearing)
  - **Documentation**: Comprehensive update to Docs/UNDO.md explaining transaction types, data synchronization, and clean state restoration
  - **User impact**: Tournament operators can now safely undo matches without worrying about orphaned resource assignments or availability conflicts. The undo system properly releases all resources for reassignment to other matches.

### Enhanced: Player List - Payment Status Indicator & Smart Sorting
- **"In Tournament" section now shows payment status and prioritizes unpaid players**
  - **Payment status indicator**: Players who have paid entrance fee show "(Paid)" label in green (13px font, subtle styling)
  - **Smart sorting**: Unpaid players appear first, paid players at bottom (both groups alphabetically sorted)
  - **Real-time sync**: Payment status and sort order update immediately when toggled in "Tournament Players" section
  - **Visual feedback**: Quick at-a-glance confirmation of who still needs to pay
  - **Implementation**: player-management.js:95-114 (sorting logic), player-management.js:107-114 (payment indicator), player-management.js:448 (sync on toggle)
  - **User impact**: Tournament organizers can instantly see which players haven't paid during registration/check-in, reducing confusion and missed payments

### Improved: Referee Suggestions Logic
- **Complete rewrite of referee suggestions system with timeline-based event tracking**
  - **Timeline approach**: Lists show history of events, not unique players (e.g., "Jack, Ken, Bob, Ken, Nick, Ken")
  - **Recent Winners**: Last 10 match wins (up from 7, configurable 5-20 in Config page)
  - **Recent Losers**: Last 10 match losses (up from 7, configurable 5-20 in Config page)
  - **Recent Assignments**: Last 10 referee assignments (up from 7, configurable 5-20 in Config page)
  - **Players can appear multiple times**: Same player can appear multiple times in same list (timeline of their activity)
  - **Players can be in all lists**: Player can simultaneously be in Winners, Losers, AND Assignments
  - **Smart filtering**: When assigned as referee, player's OLDER match results are removed from Winners/Losers (they've done their duty)
  - **Reappearance logic**: When player completes match AFTER referee duty, they reappear in Winners/Losers
  - **Unassignment handling**: Removing referee assignment immediately returns player to Winners/Losers suggestions
  - **Replacement filtering**: Replaced referees don't appear (if Ben is replaced by Bob, only Bob shows in Recent Assignments)
  - **Per-match deduplication**: Only most recent assignment per match shows (prevents same referee appearing 3x for same match)
  - **Auto-refresh on changes**: Match Controls updates immediately when referees are assigned/changed/removed
  - **Active assignment verification**: Only currently assigned referees are filtered from suggestions (not historical assignments)
  - **Configurable limit**: Added "Number of referee suggestions to show" field in Config > User Interface (5-20, default 10)
  - **Implementation**: bracket-rendering.js:2651-2900 (getRefereeSuggestions), clean-match-progression.js:1567-1631 (updateMatchReferee auto-refresh)
  - **User impact**: Tournament operators can quickly assign referees from accurate, real-time list of eligible players - dramatically speeds up tournament management

### Maintenance: CSS Cleanup & Flat Design Unification (Complete)

  - All 4 pages tested and working perfectly
  - All 13 modals tested and working with consistent button styling
  - No visual changes or regressions
  - Remaining CSS is lean, functional, and 93.6% actively used
  - **All UI components now unified under flat design button system**
  - **User impact**: Cleaner, more maintainable codebase with consistent button UX across entire application

### Project Structure: Code Organization
- **Reorganized JavaScript and CSS files into dedicated folders for cleaner project structure**
  - Created `js/` folder and moved all 11 JavaScript files
  - Created `css/` folder and moved styles.css
  - Updated tournament.html with new file paths
  - Updated documentation
  - **Result**: tournament.html now clearly visible as main entry point in root folder
  - **User impact**: More intuitive project structure, easier navigation for developers and contributors

### Enhanced: Tournament Export - Automatic Transaction History Optimization
- **Completed tournament exports now automatically optimize transaction history to reduce localStorage usage on import**
  - **Smart Pruning on Export**: Uses same algorithm as Developer Console to remove redundant transactions
  - **Conditional Optimization**: Only prunes when `tournament.status === 'completed'`
  - **Mid-Tournament Exports**: Preserve complete transaction history for backup/debugging purposes
  - **Algorithm Applied**:
    - Keeps ALL COMPLETE_MATCH transactions (match results never removed)
    - Keeps only LAST ASSIGN_LANE transaction per completed match
    - Keeps only LAST ASSIGN_REFEREE transaction per completed match
    - Removes ALL START_MATCH transactions (redundant after completion)
    - Removes ALL STOP_MATCH transactions (redundant after completion)
  - **Storage Optimization**: Typically removes 40-60% of transactions in completed tournaments
  - **Primary Benefit**: When importing a completed tournament, pruned history consumes significantly less localStorage space
  - **Secondary Benefit**: Smaller JSON file size makes sharing and archiving more convenient
  - **Silent Operation**: No user notification, happens automatically during export
  - **Implementation**: tournament-management.js:100-192 (pruneTransactionHistory helper, modified exportTournament)
  - **User impact**: Importing completed tournaments uses less localStorage space (helps prevent hitting 10 MB browser limits). Mid-tournament exports retain full history for safety and debugging. No manual pruning action required.

## **v2.5.1** - Match Controls and UI Improvements

### Enhanced: LIVE Match Sorting
- **Lane-based sorting in Match Controls**
  - LIVE matches now sort by lane assignment (ascending) first, then by match ID
  - Matches with lanes appear before matches without lanes
  - Lane order: Lane 1, Lane 2, Lane 3... (numerical ascending)
  - Within same lane status, matches sorted alphabetically by ID
  - **Benefit**: Matches organized by physical venue layout for easier tournament management
  - **Use case**: Operators can quickly find "What's on Lane 3?" without scanning through match IDs
  - **Tournament-tested**: Real-world insight from live tournament operations

### Enhanced: Config Page Reset to Defaults
- **Reset buttons for Point Values and Match Configuration**
  - Added "Reset to Defaults" button at bottom of Point Values section
  - Added "Reset to Defaults" button at bottom of Match Configuration section
  - Both buttons follow same styling pattern as other config section buttons (Branding, Lane Management)
  - **Confirmation dialog**: Prompts user before resetting to prevent accidental changes
  - **Autosave**: Changes immediately saved to localStorage after reset
  - **Auto-update**: Results table automatically refreshes when point values are reset
  - **Default values**:
    - Point Values: Participation (5), 1st (15), 2nd (13), 3rd (10), 4th (9), 5th-6th (8), 7th-8th (7), High Out (1), Ton (0), Short Leg (1), 180 (1)
    - Match Config: Regular (Best of 3), Frontside SF (Best of 5), Backside SF (Best of 3), Backside Final (Best of 5), Grand Final (Best of 5)
  - **Implementation**: `resetPointValuesToDefaults()` and `resetMatchConfigToDefaults()` in results-config.js

### Enhanced: Subtle Shadows for Depth and Actionability
- **Added subtle depth to buttons and match cards for improved visual hierarchy**
  - **Buttons**: Default state `box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)`, hover state `box-shadow: 0 2px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)`
  - **Match cards**: Applied same subtle shadow `box-shadow: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)` to "Ready to Start" cards in Match Controls
  - **Design philosophy**: Tiny accent that leads the eye in the right direction without overdoing it
  - **User benefit**: Interactive elements feel more tangible and "actionable" while maintaining clean, professional appearance
  - **Subconscious impact**: Users won't consciously notice the shadows, but will feel the interface is more polished and professional
  - **Implementation**:
    - Buttons: Applied to base `.btn` class in styles.css, automatically cascades to all button variants (.btn-success, .btn-danger, .btn-warning, .btn-small)
    - Match cards: Applied to `.cc-match-card` class (LIVE matches retain their distinctive orange glow)
  - **Affected elements**: All action buttons (Create Tournament, Add Player, Save, Reset, Load, Delete, etc.) and Ready to Start match cards
  - **Real-world tested**: Refinement based on live tournament operation observations over multiple weeks

### Fixed: Disabled Lane and Referee Assignment for Pending Matches
- **Prevents resource blocking by disabling lane/referee dropdowns for pending matches**
  - Lane and referee dropdowns now disabled when match state is 'pending' (both players not yet determined/TBD)
  - Visual feedback: Disabled dropdowns shown with reduced opacity (0.5) and not-allowed cursor
  - **Problem solved**: Operators were assigning lanes/referees to pending matches, blocking those resources from ready matches
  - **User benefit**: Lanes and referees only show as "assigned" when actually in use by ready or live matches
  - **Consistent pattern**: Aligns with disabled "Start Match" button behavior for pending matches
  - **Applies to**: Tournament bracket view only (Match Command Center doesn't show pending matches)
  - **Implementation**: Added `disabled` attribute and visual styling in bracket rendering (bracket-rendering.js:1075-1076, 1101-1102)
  - **Real-world tested**: Fix identified through live tournament operations where resource confusion occurred

### Enhanced: Read-Only Tournament Protection
- **Player statistics locked for loaded completed tournaments**
  - Clicking player names in Results Table, Match Controls, or Winner Confirmation dialogs does nothing when `tournament.readOnly === true`
  - Silent behavior - no alert, no modal, no feedback
  - Prevents accidental modification of historical tournament data
  - **Read-only condition**: Tournament must be both loaded from file AND completed
  - **Escape hatch**: Use "Reset Tournament" to clear read-only flag and make tournament editable
  - **Applies to**: All entry points to player statistics editing (Results Table rows, Match Controls player names, Winner Confirmation player names)
  - **Implementation**: Single check in `openStatsModal()` function (player-management.js:431-433)

### Fixed: Score Preservation and Dialog Flow in Winner Confirmation
- **Match score values now preserved when editing player statistics, with correct dialog restoration**
  - When clicking player names in Winner Confirmation dialog to edit stats, the leg scores (e.g., 3-1) are now saved and restored
  - Closing stats modal now properly returns to Winner Confirmation (not Match Controls)
  - Previously, scores would reset to default values (e.g., 2-0) when returning from stats modal
  - **Root cause**: Dialog stack restore function was re-initializing input fields; custom Escape handler conflicted with dialog stack Escape handling
  - **Solution**:
    - Changed dialog stack restore function to only show modal without reinitializing fields
    - Integrated stats modal properly with dialog stack instead of manual modal management
    - Enabled Escape key via dialog stack for winner confirmation, removed conflicting custom Escape handler
    - Save and restore input values after dialog stack restoration completes
  - **Implementation**: Enhanced `openStatsModalFromConfirmation()` and `showWinnerConfirmation()` in clean-match-progression.js:1570-1681, 2195-2229

### Enhanced: Tournament Bracket - Smooth Hover Zoom for LIVE Matches
- **LIVE matches now have smooth zoom transition on hover, matching other match states**
  - Removed pulsing animation from LIVE matches that conflicted with hover zoom
  - LIVE matches now smoothly zoom in when hovered (at zoom levels < 1.0) with consistent 0.3s transition
  - Previously, LIVE matches would "pop" to zoomed state without transition to avoid horrible pulsating zoom effect
  - **Visual distinction maintained**: LIVE matches still prominent with orange gradient background, thicker orange border (3px), and orange glow on hover
  - **Rationale**: Pulse animation was visually noisy and caused disorienting pulsating zoom when hovering over tiny match cards while zoomed out
  - **Implementation**: Removed `animation: pulse 2s infinite` from `.match-live` in css/styles.css:844
  - **User impact**: Consistent, smooth hover zoom behavior across all match states. Cleaner, more professional tournament bracket interaction.

### Enhanced: Tournament Bracket - READY Match Border Color
- **READY match border changed to yellow-gold for better visual distinction**
  - Border color changed from dark brown (`rgba(180, 83, 9, 0.9)`) to yellow-gold (`rgba(240, 196, 25, 0.9)`)
  - Yellow-gold border complements the yellow gradient interior and clearly distinguishes READY matches from LIVE matches (orange)
  - Maintains 90% opacity for subtle transparency consistent with original design
  - Hover state changes to fully opaque yellow-gold for clear interaction feedback
  - **Rationale**: With pulse animation removed from LIVE matches, the dark brown READY border was too similar to LIVE orange border, causing visual confusion
  - **Implementation**: Updated `.match-ready` border colors in css/styles.css:831-836
  - **User impact**: Clear visual hierarchy across match states - yellow for READY, orange for LIVE. More intuitive and cohesive bracket appearance.

# 2025-10-12

## **v2.5.0** - Developer Console

### New Feature: Developer Console
- **Hidden developer tool for real-time tournament diagnostics**
  - **Purpose**: Monitor tournament health, run validation checks, and execute developer commands without browser console
  - **Access**: Enable in Config ‚Üí User Interface ‚Üí "Enable Developer Analytics", then click version number in Tournament Status Panel
  - **Design**: Large modal (90% screen) with three-pane layout:
    - Left pane (30%): Statistics and commands
    - Right pane content area (49%): Dynamic detail views
    - Right pane console footer (21%): Persistent console output (always visible)
  - **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 2 seconds (pauses while scrolling)
  - **Settings take effect immediately**: No browser refresh required when enabling/disabling Developer Analytics

#### Statistics (Real-time Monitoring)
- **Transaction Health**: Shows current usage (X/500) with health indicators (‚úÖ <50%, ‚ö†Ô∏è 50-80%, üî¥ >80%)
- **Match State**: Breakdown of completed/live/ready/pending matches (click to view match IDs by state)
- **Player Count**: Paid vs unpaid players (click to view complete alphabetically sorted player list with IDs)
- **Lane Usage**: Current lane utilization with conflict detection (‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è), respects excluded lanes from Config

#### Validation Checks (6 Total)
1. **Lane Assignments**: Detects overlapping lane assignments for LIVE matches
2. **Referee Assignments**: Detects referees playing in matches they're refereeing
3. **Match State Integrity**: Verifies completed matches have winner/loser assigned
4. **Transaction Count**: Warns if approaching 500-entry limit (>80%)
5. **Player ID Integrity**: Detects orphaned player references in matches array (excludes walkover-*, bye-*, tbd-*, and placeholder IDs)
6. **Progression Integrity**: Verifies winners/losers are in correct downstream matches per MATCH_PROGRESSION rules

#### Developer Commands
- **Re-render Bracket**: Force visual refresh of bracket display (`renderBracket()`)
- **Recalculate Rankings**: Recompute all player placements (`calculateAllRankings()`)
- **Refresh All Dropdowns**: Update lane and referee dropdown options
- **Validate Everything**: Run all 6 validation checks, display results in right pane, log summary to console with pass/fail details
- **View Transaction History**: Display all transactions (latest first) with timestamp, type, and description
- **View Match Progression**: Display MATCH_PROGRESSION lookup tables for current bracket size

#### Console Output Footer (Persistent)
- **Always visible**: Console output footer shows last 50 entries at bottom 30% of right pane
- **Real-time updates**: Auto-refreshes every 2 seconds with new console.log entries
- **Auto-scroll**: Scrolls to bottom when new entries appear (pauses while user scrolling)
- **Smart capture**: Only intercepts console.log while Developer Console is open
- **Buffer**: Stores last 100 entries in memory, displays last 50 with timestamps
- **Independent scrolling**: Console footer scrolls separately from content area above
- **Benefits**: Monitor command execution in real-time without switching views or using browser developer tools

#### Technical Implementation
- **Files Added**:
  - `analytics.js` - Complete analytics system (console capture, validations, commands, UI management, persistent footer)
  - `Docs/ANALYTICS.md` - Comprehensive documentation (1000+ lines: features, use cases, troubleshooting, extension guide, future improvements)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `tournament.html` - Added analytics modal HTML (90% layout, three-pane design with persistent console footer) + script tag + developerMode checkbox in Config
  - `results-config.js` - Added `globalConfig.ui.developerMode` (default: false) with save/load persistence + watermark refresh on save for immediate effect
  - `tournament-management.js` - Made version number clickable when developerMode enabled, reads directly from localStorage to avoid script loading order issues
  - `styles.css` - Fixed pointer-events to allow version number clicks despite bracket viewport grab cursor, added analytics modal CSS overrides (90% height, 1% margin)
  - `dynamic-help-system.js` - Updated Config page help to document Developer Analytics feature
- **Global Functions**: All analytics functions accessible via window object for browser console debugging
- **Dialog Stack Integration**: Uses pushDialog/popDialog for proper z-index management and Escape key support
- **Smart Auto-refresh**: Updates left pane statistics + console footer every 2 seconds, only refreshes right pane Quick Overview (other views stay static for readability)
- **Three-pane Layout**: Left 30% (stats/commands), Right content 49% (detail views), Right footer 21% (persistent console)

#### Use Cases
- **Live monitoring**: Keep console open during tournament to watch transaction health, match state, and console activity in real-time
- **Issue diagnosis**: Run validation checks to identify lane conflicts, progression errors, or data corruption
- **Command execution**: Execute commands and monitor output in persistent console footer without switching views
- **Debug workflow**: Validation results and command execution logs appear immediately in always-visible console footer

## **v2.5.0** - Undo System Fixes

### Undo System Improvements

#### Fixed History Pruning Bug (Bug B)
- **Increased MAX_HISTORY_ENTRIES from 50 to 500**
  - **The problem**: History limit of 50 caused premature pruning in 32-player tournaments
  - **Impact**: Early matches (FS-R1, FS-R2) would lose their COMPLETE_MATCH transactions after ~30-40 matches completed
  - **Result**: Matches without transactions in history appeared non-undoable, even when they should be undoable
  - **The solution**: Increased limit to 500 transactions
    - 32-player bracket generates ~169 total transactions in typical tournament (62 matches + ~107 operational changes)
    - 500 provides 196% buffer for tournaments with heavy lane/referee management
    - All matches now remain undoable throughout the entire tournament

#### Fixed Transaction Type Confusion Bug (Bug A)
- **Added transaction type filtering to downstream blocking checks**
  - **The problem**: Downstream blocking check used `history.find(t => t.matchId === targetMatchId)` which returned the newest transaction for a match, regardless of type
  - **Impact**: When completed matches had operational transactions (ASSIGN_LANE, ASSIGN_REFEREE) after COMPLETE_MATCH, the check would find the wrong transaction type
  - **Result**: Matches with completed MANUAL downstream matches incorrectly showed as undoable (observed in BS-R3 ‚Üí BS-R4 scenarios)
  - **The solution**: Added `&& t.type === 'COMPLETE_MATCH'` filter to 4 locations in `isMatchUndoable()` and `getDetailedMatchState()` functions
    - Lines 1934, 1946 (isMatchUndoable winner/loser checks)
    - Lines 3695, 3707 (getDetailedMatchState winner/loser checks)
  - **Result**: Downstream blocking check now correctly finds COMPLETE_MATCH transactions only, ignoring operational transactions

### Documentation
- Updated `Docs/UNDO.md` with comprehensive undo system documentation
  - Added "Transaction History Storage and Limits" section explaining MAX_HISTORY_ENTRIES and pruning behavior
  - Added "Match Undoability Rules" section documenting complete logic for when matches can/cannot be undone
  - Expanded transaction structure to show all fields (type, description, beforeState)
  - Documented all 5 transaction types (COMPLETE_MATCH, START_MATCH, STOP_MATCH, ASSIGN_LANE, ASSIGN_REFEREE)
  - Documented Bug A (transaction type confusion) with example scenario and fix details
  - Included 4 detailed example scenarios covering common undoability cases

### Files Modified
- `clean-match-progression.js` - Increased MAX_HISTORY_ENTRIES from 50 to 500
- `bracket-rendering.js` - Added transaction type filtering to 4 locations (lines 1934, 1946, 3695, 3707)
- `Docs/UNDO.md` - Comprehensive documentation of undo system behavior and limits

# 2025-10-10

## **v2.5.0** - Distributed Seeding & Visual Consistency

### Tournament Seeding Improvements
- **Distributed BYE Placement**: Replaced sequential seeding with randomized BYE distribution
  - BYEs now randomly scattered across all FS-R1 matches instead of clustering at bottom
  - Each BYE randomly placed in either player1 or player2 slot within a match
  - **Critical fairness fix**: Old sequential system created guaranteed systematic advantage
    - **The problem**: Sequential seeding clustered BYEs at bottom of FS-R1 (matches 12-16 in 32-bracket)
    - **The chain reaction**: Bottom BYEs ‚Üí bottom FS-R2 BYEs ‚Üí 5 guaranteed BYE-vs-BYE matches in bottom BS-R1
    - **The unfair advantage**: Mirroring places FS-R2 top-half losers into BS-R2 bottom-half positions
    - **The collision**: FS-R2 top-half losers faced walkover-advanced opponents; bottom-half losers faced real winners
    - **Result**: Losing in top half of FS-R2 was predictably easier than losing in bottom half - every single tournament
  - **The solution**: Distributed seeding eliminates this structural bias
    - Example (22 players, 32-bracket): Old system guaranteed 5 BYE-vs-BYE matches in BS-R1
    - New distributed system typically produces 2-4 BYE-vs-BYE matches, randomly distributed
    - Walkover opponents appear unpredictably throughout BS-R2, not concentrated in specific regions
    - No correlation between FS-R2 bracket position and BS-R2 opponent difficulty
    - Fewer wasted walkover matches overall, more real competitive matches throughout tournament
  - Still guarantees no BYE-vs-BYE matches in FS-R1 (max 1 BYE per match)
  - Instant execution across all bracket sizes (8, 16, 32 players)
  - Mathematical guarantee: minimum players equals number of matches, ensuring algorithm always succeeds
  - Every bracket generation produces unique, random BYE distribution
  - Eliminates both the actual systematic advantage and the visual appearance of unfairness

### Visual Consistency
- Improved the design and colors of player cards in the Registration page
- Removed green borders from "In Tournament" cards (now use neutral gray like "Available Players")
- Removed checkmarks from Saved Players cards (section headers provide sufficient context)
- Normalized text styling across all player cards (consistent font weight and color)
- Maintained subtle visual distinction with light green background (#f0fdf4) for "In Tournament" cards
- Cleaner, more professional appearance while preserving functional separation

### Files Modified
- `clean-match-progression.js` - Replaced two-pass sequential seeding with distributed random BYE placement algorithm
- `player-management.js` - Removed checkmark rendering, updated card styling
- `styles.css` - Updated border colors and text styling for Saved Players cards
- `main.js` - Version bump to 2.5.0-beta

# 2025-10-09

## **v2.4.4** - Registration Page Workflow fixes
- The "x" for removing tournament players are now hidden for participants that have paid the entrance fee
- A confirmation/warning dialog is shown when removing paid players from the Saved Players column
- Updated the help section to reflect the Registration page redesign
- Added hints/instructions to the Registration page headers

## **v2.4.3** - Registration Page Redesign & Tournament Interface Improvements

### Registration Page Redesign
- **Context-Aware Two-Column Layout**: Eliminated confusing tab interface in favor of intelligent, state-aware display
  - Left column: Tournament Players (always visible during setup and active tournament)
  - Right column: Contextual content that adapts to tournament state
    - **Setup mode**: Displays Saved Players for quick player management
    - **Active/Completed mode**: Automatically switches to Tournament Results
  - Instant switching when bracket is generated - no manual tab navigation required
  - Cleaner, more intuitive workflow aligned with natural tournament progression
- **Saved Players Section Reorganization**: Two-section layout with clear visual hierarchy
  - **Available Players** section at top: Players not yet added to current tournament
  - **In Tournament** section below: Players already added to tournament (with checkmarks)
  - Both sections display in 4-column grid for efficient space usage
  - Players dynamically move between sections when clicked (add/remove from tournament)
  - Click available player to add ‚Üí moves to "In Tournament" section
  - Click tournament player to remove ‚Üí moves back to "Available Players" section
  - Clean section headers with subtle styling matching app design language
- **Improved Delete Functionality**: Context-aware deletion with clear user intent
  - Delete button (`√ó`) only visible for Available Players (hidden for In Tournament players)
  - Prevents accidental deletion of players currently in use
  - Hover tooltip: "Remove from saved players" clarifies permanent deletion
  - Confirmation dialog with clear messaging: "This permanently deletes them from your saved players list"
  - Immediate UI update after deletion (fixed bug in renderPlayerList callback)
- **Visual Polish**: Consistent header styling and improved alignment
  - Tournament Players and Saved Players headers match styling (60px height, #f5f5f5 background)
  - Player count removed from headers for cleaner appearance
  - "Saved Players" replaces ambiguous "Player List" naming
  - Import helper text: "Import from tournament export file" clarifies functionality
  - Delete button styled to match Tournament Players remove buttons (24√ó24px red outline)
- **Streamlined Player Management**: No more confusion between Tournament and Player List tabs
  - Context makes it obvious: setup shows saved players, active tournament shows results
  - Single-click add/remove between Available and In Tournament sections
  - Visual feedback with checkmarks and green backgrounds for added players
  - No confirmation dialogs for add/remove (fast workflow), confirmation only for permanent deletion
- **Intelligent State Management**: UI adapts automatically to tournament lifecycle
  - Page navigation triggers layout update to show correct content
  - Bracket generation automatically switches right column to results
  - Layout updates propagate through addPlayer, removePlayer, and tournament state changes
  - Seamless experience throughout tournament creation and execution

### Visual Enhancements
- **Match Card Score Display**: Completed matches now display final score in match header
  - Active matches show: `L: 7 | Bo3`
  - Completed matches show: `Result: 2-0`
  - Score replaces lane/Bo3 info when match is complete (contextually relevant)
  - Score numbers prominently styled: 20px, bold, green (#059669), monospace font with subtle shadow
  - "Result:" label sized at 16px for clear hierarchy
  - Match ID sized at 15px for balanced header composition
  - Score automatically reverts to lane/Bo3 display when match is undone
  - Elegant use of existing space without layout changes
- **Finals Match Round Indicators**: Simplified round indicator labels for finals matches
  - BS-FINAL and GRAND-FINAL now show "FINALS" instead of repeating match ID
  - Eliminates redundancy and frees up header space
  - Allows consistent 15px match ID sizing across all match cards including finals
- **Consistent Score Ordering**: Match scores now display in Player1 vs Player2 order across all displays
  - New `formatMatchScore()` helper function provides single source of truth for score formatting
  - Scores consistently show actual player order (e.g., if Player2 won 2-1, shows "1-2" not "2-1")
  - Applied uniformly to bracket match cards and Match Results page
  - Eliminates confusion when winner is Player2
- **Walkover Match Display**: Completed walkover matches now display "W/O" instead of lane/Bo3 info
  - Bracket match cards show "W/O" in header for auto-completed walkover matches
  - Match Results page shows "(W/O)" instead of arbitrary score numbers
  - Provides clear visual indication that match was won by walkover, not played
  - Uses same `formatMatchScore()` helper for consistent handling across all displays
- **Walkover Player Styling**: Walkover players now have consistent, context-aware styling across all match states
  - Completed matches: Walkover players display with green background matching completed match styling
  - Pending/waiting matches: Walkover players blend seamlessly with normal match card backgrounds
  - Player1 walkovers maintain pinkish background and orange left border in pending matches
  - Player2 walkovers have transparent background in pending matches
  - Eliminates visual inconsistencies where walkovers appeared in different colors across tournament bracket

### User Experience Improvements
- **Match Card Hover State Preservation**: Match cards maintain zoom state when changing lane or referee assignments
  - Removed unnecessary full bracket re-renders from lane/referee update functions
  - Only dropdown options refresh across all matches (conflict detection maintained)
  - Eliminates visual interruption and bracket blinking during dropdown changes
  - Zoom naturally ends when mouse leaves card boundaries (expected behavior)
  - Smoother, more responsive user experience when managing match details
- **Bracket Zoom Step Adjustment**: Increased zoom step from 0.015 to 0.025
  - Better balance between precision and speed for mouse wheel users
  - Still provides smooth, precise control compared to original 0.05 step
  - Maintains excellent trackpad experience while improving mouse wheel responsiveness
- **Bracket Home Button Synchronization**: Home button now resets to bracket-size-specific default views
  - 32-player brackets: Returns to optimal overview zoom (0.33) with centered positioning
  - 16-player brackets: Returns to optimized default view (0.45 zoom)
  - 8-player brackets: Returns to optimized default view (0.61 zoom)
  - Matches the initial bracket render positioning for consistent "home" behavior
  - Eliminates confusion when home button returned to different view than initial load

### Files Modified
- `tournament.html` - Removed tab structure, implemented two-column context-aware layout, removed player count from headers, added import helper text, changed container from grid to block element
- `player-management.js` - Added updateRegistrationPageLayout() for context switching, renamed renderPlayerListTab() to renderPlayerList(), separated players into availablePlayers and inTournamentPlayers arrays, conditional delete button rendering with tooltip, added confirmation dialog for deletion, fixed renderPlayerList callback bug
