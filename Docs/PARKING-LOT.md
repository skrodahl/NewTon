## âœ… Completed This Session
- **Zoomed Match Card Focus Preservation** (v2.4.3): Match cards stay zoomed when changing Lane or Referee by removing unnecessary bracket re-renders. Dropdowns update without visual interruption. Note: Zoom naturally ends when mouse leaves card boundaries (e.g., selecting dropdown options rendered outside card), which is expected behavior.
- **Player List Registry** (v2.4.0): Persistent player registry with tab interface in Registration page
- **Match Results Humanization** (v2.4.0): "Grand Final" and "Backside Final" in Setup page Match Results
- **Tournament Results Empty State** (v2.4.0): Clean "No players added yet" message when table is empty
- **Shared Tournament Delete Permission** (v2.4.0): Config setting to control delete button visibility for shared tournaments
- **Subtle Shadows** (v2.4.1): Added depth to content boxes across all pages
- **Droid Serif Typography** (v2.4.1): Application title now uses serif font for professional feel
- **Player List Tab Reordering** (v2.4.1): Player List tab now appears first and is selected by default
- **Favicon** (v2.4.1): Added favicon support using club logo
- **Sort Player List Alphabetically** (v2.4.1): Player List displays in alphabetical order for easier scanning
