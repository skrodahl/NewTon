# Parking Lot - Tournament Manager

Ideas and suggestions for future consideration.

*Raw ideas awaiting triage*

### Self-Refereeing Prevention (Optional)
Players can currently be assigned as referee in their own match. This is intentional behavior, but could be made configurable for clubs that want to prevent it.

**Consideration**: Would need a new config option (e.g., `config.lanes.preventSelfReferee`) and validation in referee assignment logic.

### Backside Match Source Visibility
No easy way to see, from a backside match, which frontside matches feed into it. Currently requires mental tracing through the bracket structure.

**Consideration**: Could show source match IDs in Match Command Center or as hover tooltip on backside matches.
