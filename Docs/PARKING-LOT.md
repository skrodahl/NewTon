 Parking Lot - Tournament Manager

## Inbox
*Raw ideas and suggestions awaiting triage*
- None

## Next
- Matches played/total in CAD-box. This shows the actual number for the full bracket, should it stay that way or reflect the actual number of matches without BYEs?

## Later
*Not urgent but worth tracking*
- None

## Decided against
- Player cards shadow matching results table [ui] - styles.css - Add shadow to .player-card
- Status line, include Lane and Referee information

## âœ… Completed This Session
- Configurable club name, instead of Application Title
- CAD-style info in lower right corner instead of tournament name/date.
