Ideas and suggestions for future consideration.

*Raw ideas awaiting triage*

### Self-Refereeing Prevention (Optional)
Players can currently be assigned as referee in their own match. This is intentional behavior, but could be made configurable for clubs that want to prevent it.

**Consideration**: Would need a new config option (e.g., `config.lanes.preventSelfReferee`) and validation in referee assignment logic.

### ~~Backside Match Source Visibility~~ ✅ IMPLEMENTED (v4.1.0)
~~No easy way to see, from a backside match, which frontside matches feed into it.~~

**Implemented**: Status bar now shows "Fed by FS-X-X, FS-X-X" when hovering over backside matches, indicating which frontside matches feed into them.
