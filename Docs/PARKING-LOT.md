 Parking Lot - Tournament Manager

## Inbox
*Raw ideas and suggestions awaiting triage*

## Next
*Items ready for implementation*
- Match Results, Setup page: Change BS-FINAL to Backside Final
- Leads to: Grand Final and Backside Final, Placement
- **Shared Tournament Delete Permission**: Add config setting to control who can delete shared tournaments
  - Default: Disabled (no delete buttons shown)
  - Consideration: Prevents accidental deletion of shared tournaments
  - Use case: Hosted deployments where only admins should delete
  - Implementation: Config checkbox, conditional delete button rendering

## Later
*Not urgent but worth tracking*
- **Player Register**: Database of regular players selectable from dropdown or card interface during player registration
  - Benefit: Faster registration for recurring participants
  - Consideration: Need player data persistence across tournaments
  - Use case: Clubs with regular player base

## Decided against
- None

## âœ… Completed This Session
- Review modal contents
- Registration page scrolling, background is permanent/does not scroll
