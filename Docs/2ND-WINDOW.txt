VIEW TOURNAMENT PROGRESSION ON A SECOND MONITOR:

Open a second browser window on a second monitor to see tournament progression.

To automatically update the tournament view in the second window, run the following command in the browser console (Ctrl-Shift-J or F12 -> Console):

// Sync every 5 seconds (5000 milliseconds)
const syncInterval = setInterval(() => {
    autoLoadCurrentTournament();
}, 5000);

To stop the automatic syncing later:

  clearInterval(syncInterval);

You can adjust the timing:
  - Every 2 seconds: 2000
  - Every 10 seconds: 10000
  - Every 30 seconds: 30000

  For a tournament setting, every 5-10 seconds is probably reasonable to catch match updates without being too
  frequent.
