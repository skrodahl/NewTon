# NewTon DC Tournament Manager v3.0.2 Release Notes

**Release Date:** October 2025
**Incremental Release**

---

## Overview

**NewTon DC Tournament Manager Version 3.0.2** brings Docker deployment support for self-hosting, referee conflict improvements, and quality-of-life refinements.

This release contains no breaking changes and is a drop-in replacement for v3.0.1.

**Key Highlights:**
- Docker containerization for easy self-hosting
- Improved referee conflict detection (self-refereeing support)
- Extended transaction history capacity (500 ‚Üí 1000)
- UI spacing and layout refinements

---

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

Self-hosting NewTon Tournament Manager is now effortless with full Docker support.

**What You Get:**
- Lightweight Alpine-based container (~60MB)
- nginx + PHP-FPM for optimal performance
- Full PHP REST API support for tournament sharing
- Multi-architecture builds (Intel/AMD + Apple Silicon/Raspberry Pi)
- Automated builds published to GitHub Container Registry
- Persistent storage for uploaded tournaments

**Quick Start:**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name newton-tournament \
  -p 8080:80 \
  -v ./tournaments:/var/www/html/tournaments \
  ghcr.io/skrodahl/newton-darts:latest
```

**Why It Matters:**
Clubs can now easily host their own tournament manager instance on a server, enabling centralized tournament archives and multi-device access without relying on external services.

**Documentation:**

- `docker/README.md` - Docker-specific quick reference
- `Docs/DOCKER.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide with reverse proxy setup

## ‚öñÔ∏è Referee Improvements

**Self-Refereeing Support:**
Players can now referee their own matches without triggering conflict warnings. The system still prevents players from refereeing one match while playing in another - it just recognizes that self-refereeing is valid.

**Why It Matters:**
Common in smaller tournaments where players take turns refereeing. The previous version would incorrectly block starting matches when a player was assigned as their own referee.

---

## üìä Extended Transaction History

**Increased Capacity:**
Transaction history limit doubled from 500 to 1000 entries, providing even more operational headroom for complex tournaments.

**Why It Matters:**
Combined with the storage optimization from v3.0.1 (97% size reduction), tournaments can now handle 100+ completed matches with extensive lane/referee reassignments without any concern about hitting storage limits. This eliminates the last theoretical corner case for transaction capacity.

---

## üé® UI Refinements

**Consistency Improvements:**
- Fixed spacing between page titles and content (Setup page now matches Registration page)
- Adjusted payment QR code display size (200px ‚Üí 175px) for better visual balance on lower resolution displays

**Why It Matters:**
Consistent visual rhythm across all pages and improved layout density for compact displays commonly used at tournament venues.
