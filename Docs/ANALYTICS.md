# Developer Console Documentation

## Overview

The Developer Console is a hidden diagnostic tool designed for developers to monitor tournament health, run validation checks, and execute developer commands in real-time. It provides deep insights into the tournament's internal state without requiring browser developer tools.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time statistics (auto-refresh every 2 seconds)
- 6 comprehensive validation checks
- Developer commands (re-render, recalculate, validate, refresh)
- Console output capture and display
- Transaction history viewer
- Match progression rule reference

---

## Enabling Developer Console

### Step 1: Enable in Config

1. Navigate to **Config** page
2. Scroll to **User Interface** section
3. Check the box: **‚òê Enable Developer Analytics**
4. Setting is saved automatically to `globalConfig.developerMode`

**Default State:** Disabled (unchecked)

**Persistence:** Setting persists across browser sessions and all tournaments

### Step 2: Access the Console

1. Navigate to **Tournament** page
2. Locate the version number in the bottom-right of the CAD-box (e.g., "v2.5.0-beta")
3. Click on the version number

## Console Output Footer

### Persistent Console Log

The Console Output footer is always visible at the bottom 30% of the right pane, providing real-time visibility into console activity.

### How It Works

The Developer Console intercepts `console.log()` calls while the modal is open, capturing output for persistent display in the footer.

**Implementation:**
1. Modal opens ‚Üí saves original `console.log` function
2. Replaces `console.log` with custom function that:
   - Calls original function (logs still appear in browser console)
   - Captures message and timestamp to buffer
   - Updates Console Output footer automatically every 2 seconds
3. Modal closes ‚Üí restores original `console.log` function

**Display Behavior:**
- Shows last 50 entries in footer (most recent at bottom)
- Auto-scrolls to bottom when new entries appear
- Pauses auto-scroll while user is actively scrolling
- Each entry shows timestamp and message
- Independent scrolling from content area above

**Buffer Limits:**
- Stores last 100 entries in memory
- Displays last 50 entries in footer
- Older entries automatically removed (FIFO)

**What Gets Captured:**
- All `console.log()` calls from any JavaScript code
- Command execution logs
- Function outputs
- Error messages (if logged via console.log)

**What Doesn't Get Captured:**
- `console.error()`, `console.warn()`, `console.info()` (only console.log)
- Logs before Developer Console was opened
- Browser-generated console messages

**Benefits:**
- Always visible - no need to switch views to see console activity
- Real-time monitoring - immediate feedback on command execution
- Context preserved - view details in content area while monitoring console below
- No browser console needed - all diagnostic info in one place

---

## Auto-Refresh System

### Behavior

**Refresh Rate:** Every 2 seconds

**What Refreshes:**
- Left pane statistics
- Right pane content (current view)
- Timestamp

**Smart Pausing:**
- Detects when user is scrolling in right pane
- Pauses refresh during scroll
- Resumes 1 second after scroll stops

**Purpose:** Prevent scroll position jumping during user interaction

**Manual Control:** None - always active while modal open

---

## Global JavaScript Functions

All Developer Console functions are accessible from browser console for advanced debugging.

## Technical Architecture

### File Structure
- **analytics.js** - Complete analytics system (single file)
- **tournament.html** - Modal HTML structure + script loading
- **results-config.js** - globalConfig.developerMode persistence
- **tournament-management.js** - Version number click handler
- **styles.css** - Analytics-specific styling

### Integration Points
- **Config page** - Enable/disable checkbox
- **Tournament page** - Version number click handler
- **LocalStorage** - globalConfig.developerMode persistence
- **Global functions** - Calls existing tournament functions (renderBracket, calculateAllRankings, etc.)

### Dependencies
Relies on existing global functions:
- `getTournamentHistory()` - Transaction history
- `getMatchState()` - Match state determination
- `validateLaneAssignments()` - Lane conflict detection
- `renderBracket()` - Bracket rendering
- `calculateAllRankings()` - Ranking calculation
- `refreshAllLaneDropdowns()` - Lane dropdown refresh
- `refreshAllRefereeDropdowns()` - Referee dropdown refresh
- `MATCH_PROGRESSION` - Progression lookup tables
- Global arrays: `matches`, `players`, `tournament`, `config`

### Module Loading
analytics.js is loaded last in tournament.html after all other modules:
```html
<script src="main.js"></script>
<script src="lane-management.js"></script>
<script src="tournament-management.js"></script>
<script src="player-management.js"></script>
<script src="clean-match-progression.js"></script>

## Extending the Developer Console

### Adding New Validation Checks

1. **Create validation function** in analytics.js:
```javascript
function validateMyNewCheck() {
    // Your validation logic
    const issues = [];

    // Check for problems
    if (somethingWrong) {
        issues.push('Description of issue');
    }

    return {
        name: 'My New Check',
        valid: issues.length === 0,
        message: issues.length === 0 ? 'All valid' : `${issues.length} issue(s)`,
        details: issues
    };
}
```

2. **Add to runAllValidations()** array:
```javascript
function runAllValidations() {
    return [
        validateLaneConflicts(),
        validateRefereeAssignments(),
        validateMatchStateIntegrity(),
        validateTransactionCount(),
        validatePlayerIdIntegrity(),
        validateProgressionIntegrity(),
        validateMyNewCheck()  // Add here
    ];
}
```

3. **Update documentation** - Add check description to this file

---

### Adding New Commands

1. **Create command function** in analytics.js:
```javascript
function commandMyNewCommand() {
    console.log('Executing my new command...');

    // Your command logic
    if (typeof myFunction === 'function') {
        myFunction();
        console.log('‚úì Command completed');
    } else {
        console.error('myFunction not available');
    }
}
```

2. **Expose globally** (bottom of analytics.js):
```javascript
window.commandMyNewCommand = commandMyNewCommand;
```

3. **Add to left pane HTML** in tournament.html:
```html
<a href="#" onclick="commandMyNewCommand(); return false;">My New Command</a>
```

4. **Update documentation** - Add command description to this file

---

### Adding New Statistics

1. **Create statistics function** in analytics.js:
```javascript
function getMyNewStats() {
    // Calculate your statistics
    return {
        value1: 42,
        value2: 'OK'
    };
}
```

2. **Update updateStatisticsPane()** to include new stat

3. **Create detail view function**:
```javascript
function showMyNewDetails() {
    currentView = 'mynew';

    const stats = getMyNewStats();

    const html = `
        <h4>My New Statistics</h4>
        <div style="line-height: 1.8;">
            <p><strong>Value 1:</strong> ${stats.value1}</p>
            <p><strong>Value 2:</strong> ${stats.value2}</p>
        </div>
    `;

    updateRightPane(html);
}
```

4. **Add to refreshAnalytics()** switch statement

5. **Add to left pane HTML** in tournament.html

6. **Update documentation** - Add statistics description to this file

---

## Future Improvements

The following UX improvements have been identified for future implementation:

### 1. Statistics Click Behavior Improvements

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Partially Implemented** - Player Count detail view completed in v2.5.0-beta

#### Player Count Detail View ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED
When clicking "Player Count", shows:
- Complete alphabetically sorted list of paid players with IDs
- Complete alphabetically sorted list of unpaid players with IDs
- Total counts for each category

#### Lane Usage Detail View ‚è≥ PLANNED
When clicking "Lane Usage", show:
```
Lane Usage Details

Available: 1-10 (10 total lanes)
Excluded: None
In Use: 3, 5, 7 (3 lanes)

‚úÖ No conflicts detected

Live Matches Using Lanes:
- Lane 3: FS-2-1 (John vs Mary)
- Lane 5: BS-1-2 (Bob vs Sue)
- Lane 7: FS-3-1 (Tom vs Lisa)
```

---

### 2. Command Execution Feedback

**Current Issue**: Commands execute silently with no visual confirmation. Users only see console.log output if Console Output view is open.

**Proposed Solution**: Show command execution results in right pane with timestamp and status.

#### Re-render Bracket Feedback
```
Command Executed: Re-render Bracket

‚úì Bracket re-rendered successfully
Time: 11:38:45 PM

[Back to Overview]
```

#### Recalculate Rankings Feedback
```
Command Executed: Recalculate Rankings

‚úì Rankings recalculated for 32-player bracket
‚úì 29 players ranked
Time: 11:38:50 PM

[View Results] [Back to Overview]
```

#### Refresh All Dropdowns Feedback
```
Command Executed: Refresh All Dropdowns

‚úì Lane dropdowns refreshed (62 matches)
‚úì Referee dropdowns refreshed (62 matches)
Time: 11:38:52 PM

[Back to Overview]
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear visual confirmation commands executed
- Timestamp shows when action occurred
- Quick navigation back to overview
- No need to check Console Output view

---

### 3. Validation UX Improvements

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Partially Implemented** - Console output added in v2.5.0-beta

**Implemented in v2.5.0-beta:**
- ‚úÖ "Validate Everything" now logs summary to console footer
- ‚úÖ Individual check results with ‚úÖ/‚ö†Ô∏è icons in console
- ‚úÖ Failure details logged with indentation
- ‚úÖ Pass/fail counts displayed

**Remaining Improvements:**

#### Add Validation Status to Statistics
```
Lane Usage
0/8 in use ‚úÖ (validated 11:38:45)

Transaction Health
93/500 (19%) ‚úÖ (validated 11:38:45)
```

#### Enhanced Validation Results Display
```
Validation Results (ran at 11:38:45 PM)

‚úÖ Lane Assignments: No conflicts
‚úÖ Referee Assignments: No conflicts
‚ö†Ô∏è Match State Integrity: 2 issues detected
   - FS-2-1: Completed but missing winner
   - BS-1-3: Completed but missing loser
‚úÖ Transaction Count: 93/500 (healthy)
‚úÖ Player ID Integrity: All valid
‚úÖ Progression Integrity: All valid

Overall Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è 2 issues require attention

[Re-run Validation] [Export Report] [Back to Overview]
```

#### Validation Timing Options
Consider adding:
- **Manual validation**: User clicks "Run Validation" (current behavior)
- **Auto-validation on open**: Run validation when Developer Console opens (initial health check)
- **Periodic validation**: Run automatically every 2 seconds with stats refresh (shows issues immediately)

**Benefits:**
- Clear visibility of when validation last ran
- Actionable results with specific issue descriptions
- Export capability for bug reports
- Overall health status at a glance

---

### 4. Reorganize Left Pane Menu Structure

**Current Issue**: View commands (informational) and action commands (modify state) are mixed together, making it unclear which items show data vs execute actions.

**Proposed Reorganization:**

```
STATISTICS (clickable to show details)
- Transaction Health
- Match State
- Player Count
- Lane Usage

VIEWS (show data, read-only)
- View Transaction History
- View Match Progression

COMMANDS (execute actions, modify state)
- Re-render Bracket
- Recalculate Rankings
- Refresh All Dropdowns
- Run Validation

Last updated: 11:38:57 PM
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear mental model: Statistics ‚Üí Views ‚Üí Commands
- Easier to find what you're looking for
- Distinguishes read-only from state-modifying operations
- More consistent with application structure

---

### 5. Console Output Enhancements

**Current Implementation**: ‚úÖ Console footer is always visible at bottom of modal, showing last 50 entries with auto-scroll.

**Possible Future Enhancements:**

1. **Persistent console buffer**: Start capturing when Developer Mode is enabled (not just when modal opens)
   - **Pro**: Captures everything from page load, useful for debugging initialization
   - **Con**: Memory overhead, may capture sensitive data

2. **Console output export**: Add button to export/download console log as text file
   - **Pro**: Easy to share diagnostic logs
   - **Con**: Additional UI complexity

3. **Filter/search**: Add ability to filter console entries by keyword or time range
   - **Pro**: Easier to find relevant entries in long logs
   - **Con**: Additional UI complexity

**Priority**: Low - Current implementation meets core needs

---

### 6. Additional Validation Checks

**Potential Future Checks:**

- **Tournament State Consistency**: Verify tournament.status matches actual state (completed matches, remaining matches)
- **Placement Integrity**: Check that tournament.placements align with match outcomes
- **BYE Propagation**: Verify no BYE players advanced past FS-R1 or BS-R2 (tournament logic enforcement)
- **Active Match Count**: Warn if more than configured maximum matches are active/live
- **Circular References**: Detect any circular references in match progression
- **Data Type Validation**: Verify all match/player fields have correct data types

---

### 7. Export and Reporting

**Enhancement Ideas:**

- **Export Validation Report**: Download validation results as JSON or text file
- **Export Debug Package**: Bundle tournament JSON + transaction history + validation results + console output
- **Copy Formatted Report**: Copy validation results to clipboard in markdown format for GitHub issues
- **Screenshot Capture**: Capture current view as image for bug reports

---

### 8. Performance Optimizations

**For Large Tournaments:**

- **Lazy Loading**: Only render visible portion of transaction history (virtual scrolling)
- **Pagination**: Show transaction history in pages of 50 instead of all at once
- **Debounced Refresh**: Increase refresh interval to 5 seconds if transaction count > 300
- **Memoization**: Cache validation results until relevant data changes

---

### 9. Second Monitor Support Command

**Purpose**: Add a Developer Console command to enable automatic tournament syncing on a second monitor/display.

**Current Workaround** (documented in `Docs/2ND-WINDOW.txt`):
- Open second browser window on second monitor
- Manually run `setInterval(() => { autoLoadCurrentTournament(); }, 5000)` in browser console
- Manually stop with `clearInterval(syncInterval)` when done

**Proposed Command**: "Start Second Monitor Sync"

**Implementation Ideas:**

#### Option 1: Simple Toggle Command
```
Commands (Left Pane):
- Start Second Monitor Sync
  - Clicking starts auto-sync on current window
  - Button text changes to "Stop Second Monitor Sync"
  - Console logs: "Second monitor sync started (5s interval)"
  - Clicking again stops sync
```

#### Option 2: Dedicated View
```
Second Monitor Sync

Status: ‚≠ï Not Running

Instructions:
1. Open second browser window on second monitor
2. Navigate to Tournament page in second window
3. Open Developer Console in second window (this window)
4. Click "Start Sync" below

[Start Sync (5s)] [Start Sync (10s)] [Stop Sync]

Current interval: 5 seconds
Last sync: Never
```

#### Option 3: New Browser Window Command
```
Command: Open Second Monitor Window

Execution:
1. Opens new browser window with window.open()
2. Automatically loads tournament page
3. Starts auto-sync on new window (5s interval)
4. Original window shows: "Second monitor active"
5. Closing Developer Console stops sync in second window
```

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates need to manually run console commands
- User-friendly toggle in familiar Developer Console interface
- Consistent with existing command structure
- Easy to start/stop during tournament

**Use Case:**
Tournament organizer wants to display live bracket progression on a second monitor/TV for participants to view, while operating tournament controls on primary monitor.

**Technical Notes:**
- Would call existing `autoLoadCurrentTournament()` function
- Uses standard `setInterval()` / `clearInterval()` pattern
- Interval configurable (5s, 10s, 30s options)
- Could store sync state in `globalConfig` for persistence

**Priority**: Low - Nice quality-of-life feature, current workaround is acceptable

### 10. Improved Match Progression Visuals

**Purpose**: Enhance the "View Match Progression" display for better readability and understanding of tournament bracket flow.

**Current Implementation**:
Shows MATCH_PROGRESSION lookup table in monospace text format:
```
FS-1-1:
  Winner ‚Üí FS-2-1 (player1)
  Loser ‚Üí BS-1-1 (player1)
```

**Proposed Enhancements**:

#### Option 1: Visual Bracket Flow Diagram
Display match progression as a mini visual bracket with arrows showing winner/loser paths:
```
       ‚îå‚îÄ FS-2-1 (Winner)
FS-1-1 ‚î§
       ‚îî‚îÄ BS-1-1 (Loser)

       ‚îå‚îÄ FS-2-1 (Winner)
FS-1-2 ‚î§
       ‚îî‚îÄ BS-1-1 (Loser)
```

#### Option 2: Color-Coded Progression Table
Add color coding and icons for better visual distinction:
```
FS-1-1: Match 1, Round 1 (Frontside)
  ‚úÖ Winner ‚Üí FS-2-1 (player1)  [Advances to Round 2]
  ‚¨áÔ∏è Loser ‚Üí BS-1-1 (player1)   [Drops to Backside]

BS-FINAL: Backside Final
  üèÜ Winner ‚Üí GRAND-FINAL (player1)  [Grand Final qualifier]
  ‚ùå Loser ‚Üí Eliminated (3rd place)
```

#### Option 3: Interactive Highlight
Click on a match ID to see its progression rules highlighted in the right pane with visual emphasis:
```
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
     MATCH: FS-2-1
‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ

üìç CURRENT MATCH
Round 2, Frontside

‚¨ÖÔ∏è INCOMING PLAYERS
From FS-1-1 (winner ‚Üí player1)
From FS-1-2 (winner ‚Üí player2)

‚û°Ô∏è OUTGOING DESTINATIONS
Winner advances to: FS-3-1 (player1)
Loser drops to: BS-2-1 (player1)

‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ
```

#### Option 4: Searchable/Filterable View
Add search box to filter progression rules by match ID:
```
Search: [FS-2-____]  [Filter by: Frontside ‚ñº]

Showing 8 matches (8 total)

FS-2-1:
  Winner ‚Üí FS-3-1 (player1)
  Loser ‚Üí BS-2-1 (player1)

FS-2-2:
  Winner ‚Üí FS-3-1 (player2)
  Loser ‚Üí BS-2-1 (player2)
...
```

**Benefits:**
- Easier to understand bracket flow at a glance
- Reduces need to mentally parse text format
- Better visual hierarchy shows match relationships
- Useful for tournament organizers learning the system
- Helpful for troubleshooting progression issues

**Use Cases:**
- **Learning bracket structure**: New tournament organizers understanding double elimination flow
- **Debugging progression errors**: Quickly verify where winners/losers should advance
- **Tournament planning**: Visualize bracket structure before running tournament
- **Documentation**: Take screenshots for external documentation or training materials

**Technical Notes:**
- Could use Unicode box-drawing characters for ASCII art diagrams
- Color coding would require CSS classes for styled text
- Interactive highlighting would require click handlers on match IDs
- Search/filter would require JavaScript filtering logic on MATCH_PROGRESSION data

**Priority**: Low - Current text format is functional, enhancement is purely visual/UX improvement
