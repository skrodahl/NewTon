## Chalker Improvements

**Two-Line Result Display:**

The end-of-match result now displays on two lines for better readability on phone screens:
- Line 1: "Player 1 vs Player 2" with the winner's name highlighted in green
- Line 2: Final leg score centered below (e.g., "2 - 1")

**Per-Leg Stats Reorganization:**

Each statistic in the per-leg breakdown now appears on its own line:
- Average (bold, primary stat)
- Darts count (green highlight if short leg)
- Checkout score (green highlight if 101+)
- 180s count
- Tons count

This layout is much easier to read on narrow phone screens compared to the previous combined format.

## Chalker Status

The NewTon Chalker companion app continues to mature with each release. While still in beta (no Tournament Manager integration), it provides a polished standalone scoring experience for referees at the board.
