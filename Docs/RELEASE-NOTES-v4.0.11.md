## Overview

**NewTon DC Tournament Manager Version 4.0.11** refines the user interface with darts-themed typography and improved demo site header spacing.

This release contains no breaking changes and is a drop-in replacement for v4.0.10.

**Key Highlights:**
- Page header now uses Insignia Regular font (Unicorn darts certificate font)
- Improved visual spacing in demo mode header

## 🎨 UI Improvements

**Darts-Themed Typography:**

The page title now used "Insignia Regular" font instead of "Droid Serif". This is the font Unicorn uses on their dart weight certificates - a subtle nod to darts culture for tournament organizers.

**What Changed:**
- Main application title updated to Insignia Regular font
- Professional appearance maintained with improved thematic consistency
- Font file included in project (`fonts/Insignia-Regular.otf`)

**Why It Matters:**
Small details matter in specialized software. Using a font associated with professional darts equipment adds authenticity and shows attention to the sport's culture.

**Demo Header Spacing:**

The demo mode header banner now has better visual separation between the descriptive text and the "View on GitHub" link.

**What Changed:**
- Added spacing and hyphen separator between information and action link
- Clearer distinction between informational text and clickable elements

**Why It Matters:**
Improved readability helps first-time visitors quickly understand the demo site while easily finding the repository link.
