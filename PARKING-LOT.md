 Parking Lot - Tournament Manager

## Inbox
*Raw ideas and suggestions awaiting triage*
- Undo dialog: Convert to a richer dialog, like the Match Completion dialog [ux] - bracket-rendering.js:handleSurgicalUndo()
- Match completion dialog: Add which match winner advances to, and which match loser is moved to (or eliminated) [ux] - clean-match-progression.js:showWinnerConfirmation()
- (Experimental) Render match cards to align with previous rounds [render]
- Match Details dialog: Convert to a richer dialog, like Match Completion Dialog. Investigate if it could display even more useful information [ux] - bracket-rendering.js:showMatchDetails()
- (destructive behavior) Show a confirmation dialog when loading an existing tournament [ux]

## Next  
*Promoted items to consider soon (max 3 items)*
- Render BS-FINAL after FS Semifinal, Render GRAND-FINAL after BS-FINAL [render] - bracket-rendering.js:renderFinalMatches()
- Setup page: Do not show active tournament/date in the tournament creation input boxes [ux]
- Move "Create Tournament" button to the right of the input boxes [ux]

## Later
*Not urgent but worth tracking*
- Player cards shadow matching results table [ui] - styles.css - Add shadow to .player-card
- Setup page: Show match history for the active tournament in a column to the right of "Recent Tournaments" [feature]
